This home quarantine has gifted me with a new hobby. In the past few days, I tried to learn video editing and basic VFX and eventually made a video from the clips that I recorded last year. I have a plan to make moto vlogs, travel videos and motorcycle-related videos hence opened a youtube channel!</br>
Special thanks to [Sazidur Rahman Saad](https://www.facebook.com/sazidsaad "Sazidur Rahman Saad") for making a logo for my channel! We have plans to make videos together.
